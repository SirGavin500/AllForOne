 // Made 10 endpoints in swagger for all of the mini challenges from the combine 

 // You can add multiple dates with description.

// Person who Peer Reviewed your assignment: Isaias Gonzalez
// All of your endpoints use query arguments instead of route arguments, is this intentional?
// AddTwoNumbers could use a more interesting API response, such as "1 + 2 = 3".
// OddOrEven could use a more interesting API response, such as "0 is even".
// RestaurantPicker has an unusual API route, consider changing it.
